# Dragger

Utility to manage drag and drop of files/directories.

Files and directories can be dragged or passed as arguments to dragger
which saves them to be later dragged into some other application.

# Usage
```
dragger file1.txt
```

# Motivation
Using ranger as file manager makes it difficult for me to manage files
between other GUI applications.  Applications such as browsers which
support drag and drop have to be supplemented with some other GUI file
manager such as Nautilus to properly drag the files in to them. I
couldn't find anything else built for this purpose other than a paid
Mac app.


# TODOs
- [x] Pass files via command line params
- [x] Drag files out window to any other GUI application
- [ ] Thin out fontawesome
- [X] Drag files into Dragger
- [ ] Remove files when dragged out
- [ ] Use file previews instead of fontawesome icons
- [ ] Clubbing of files
